Shape Calculator:-

This Java program calculates the area, perimeter, and volume (for 3D shapes) of various geometric shapes. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

Shapes Supported
2D Shapes
Rectangle

Area: length * width

Perimeter: 2 * (length + width)

Circle

Area: π * radius²

Perimeter (Circumference): 2 * π * radius

Square

Area: side²

Perimeter: 4 * side

Triangle

Area: Calculated using Heron's formula

Perimeter: Sum of all sides

3D Shapes
Cube

Surface Area: 6 * side²

Perimeter: 12 * side

Volume: side³

Cuboid

Surface Area: 2 * (length * breadth + breadth * height + height * length)

Perimeter: 4 * (length + breadth + height)

Volume: length * breadth * height
